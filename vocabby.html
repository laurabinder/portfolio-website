                  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                  <p>
                    For certain goals in life, it is necessary to leave the comfort zone and acquire new skills.
                    A common goal is learning new languages - whether it is to be able to communicate better on holiday,
                    to have new perspectives at work or simply for the joy of learning something new.
                    This is where the Vocabby app comes in.

                  <h3>The Process</h3>
                  <p>
                    In order to better understand what the real obstacles and challenges are in learning new languages,
                    I have approached the project from different perspectives. I started by researching the topic and analysing
                    various competing products. On this basis, I started with the first interviews with users, from which a
                    lot of information could be derived for a later User Persona. After setting up the information architecture,
                    I continued with the creation of the first wireframes and the resulting userbility tests.

                  <h3>The Goal</h3>
                  <p>
                    By focusing the learning process on planned events in the future and by supporting time planning,
                    the aim is to ensure that Vocabby users stick to their
                    goals until the planned event and do not lose focus and give up.

                    The following points have come up in the first comparisons of competitor products:

                  <ul>
                    <li>It would be nice to be reminded of the breaks when you study for too long</li>
                    <li>Instead of only offering fixed language targets, it might be useful to add a free category</li>
                    <li>Feedback should be based mainly on positive experiences</li>
                    <li>The navigation interface must be very easy to use</li>
                    <li>A relaxed colour impression is important</li>
                    <li>Learning should be taught in a playful way</li>

                    To deepen these initial starting points, I conducted interviews with 4 people who wanted to
                    learn a new language for different reasons. Among other things, I wanted to find out what methods
                    are used for learning vocabulary, how much time is invested, what hurdles have to be taken when
                    learning and whether there are any little tricks that might help the individuals to learn better.

                    Based on the initial findings, I developed a

                    Five people took part in this test, each of them had to solve two tasks.
                    Some changes to the basic design have come to light:

                      <h2>Challanges</h2>
                      <p>
                        As my first UX-oriented project, the development of Vocabby was an exciting and challenging task for me.
                        Especially when creating and conducting the interviews, I was able to build up a lot of new knowledge and
                        gain valuable insights into a user-centred view.
                        I also found the use of the simplest methods (such as the quick sketching of paper wireframes)
                        particularly impressive, in order to reach the goal quickly and efficiently with quick tests.
                        What I can also learn from this project is that new tasks were rather difficult for me to estimate in terms of
                        time, which is why I have taken special care in future projects to keep an eye on the time in order to
                        be able to derive an average value from it.

                          I would also like to develop the project further and have identified the following points for myself:

                        <ul>
                          <li>Testing of the improved prototype</li>
                          <li>Make adjustments</li>
                          <li>Is the project still on target or do further adjustments need to be made?</li>
